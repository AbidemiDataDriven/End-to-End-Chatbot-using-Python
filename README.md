An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. Creating an end-to-end Chatbot involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users.

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself. To create an end-to-end chatbot using Python, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

Define Intents

 Create training data

Train the chatbot

Build the chatbot

Test the chatbot

Deploy the chatbot
